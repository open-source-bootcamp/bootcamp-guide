# Networking activities

When running this event, the biggest piece of feedback we have received from folks early in career is that the networking they are doing at a longer event. Sharing learning time with a room of people over 2 days with time to eat together provides many opportunities to talk and learn from each other.

It is easy however for folks to not get involved in conversations if there isn't ice-breakers to encourage folks to chat. It can also be fun to offer prizes to bring a sense of friendly competition. These should be low value items like stickers or other swag.

When you register attendees for this event, you should be asking if the attendees need any accommodations. You must take these into consideration when planning activities.

Here are some suggestions for networking activities and games that can lift the atmosphere and get folks working together. Games work well as people bond well over play.

## Scavenger hunt

Scavenger hunts are are great way to get teams exploring the event space together. Hide small items around the event space in advance and ask people to find them based off clues or finding a specific item.

For example, in the Microsoft Reactor in Redmond, there is a display cabinet with old software boxes. One scavenger hunt is to find the 'oldest object in the building apart from fixtures, fittings and people. This leads them to finding the cabinet, then finding the oldest thing inside (a paper tape of Altair Basic from Micro Soft in 1975).

## Connect on LinkedIn

[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) is a social media platform for professional networking and is a good way for attendees to connect if they are looking for future career opportunities. Give the attendees time to connected on LinkedIn with as many people as possible.

LinkedIn has a handy feature where you can share your connection details using a QR code. Instructions are available on the [LinkedIn help site](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a525286/using-a-linkedin-qr-code-to-connect-with-members).

## Cube-off

Who's the best at CubeFlyer?

This is a fun game to run at the start of day 2 taking advantage of the attendees playing with CubeFlyer the day before as they contribute. Get the teams from day 1 to compete on CubeFlyer to see who is the best. Each team member should have 1 timed turn to see how long they can play for, with the best flyer going to a championship!

In the championship, pit the winners of each team against each other. Each champion has 1 timed turn on a setup that everyone can watch such as using the device used to project the presentations, with the winner being the one who flies the longest.

Encourage teams to cheer on their champion. Do a count down to each player flying and get the attendees to join in this count down. Encourage as much celebration for the winner as for the losers, maybe even awarding a prize for the worst flyer.

## Coming up with your own ideas

Feel free to come up with your own (and if they are successful please raise a [PR](https://github.com/open-source-bootcamp/bootcamp-guide/pulls) to add them here).

If you come up with games, avoid anything that involves:

* Making people stand up and speak (such as everyone has to say a 'fun' fact about themselves). Some folks do not like being on show, or may not be confident speaking in the language used for the event.
* Giving out personal details. Ideally everyone should have a name badge so they can add their preferred name and pronouns, but never ask for more personal details that this.

> NOTE: It is important that these events are optional. Some folks won't want to be involved, and they should not be forced to do so, nor should the be made to feel not a part of the event for not taking part in these networking games. Forcing someone to be involved, or mocking someone for not being involved is a code of conduct breach and should be treated accordingly.
