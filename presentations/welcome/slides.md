# The PacMan rule

<!--

We encourage you all to follow the PacMan rule. When talking, it is natural to form a circle so everyone in the conversation can see each other. This discourages others from joining in the conversation.

It is better to leave an empty space in the circle, like the mouth of PacMan. This way new folks can join the conversation. They can join by stepping into the space, and the circle should then grow to make a new space.

Update this slide to list the entire mentor team and all the speakers. This slide works best with no more than 6 people on it. If you need more, add another slide.

Images used here are from This-Person-Does-not-Exist.com.

When you introduce the mentors, ask them to stand up or otherwise make themselves known to the attendees so the attendees know who to seek out when they have questions. In advance of this slide, make sure you have confirmed with them how to pronounce their names correctly.
