# Welcome slide deck

This folder contains an example slide deck to use when welcoming attendees to this event. This slide deck should be used for both days as it contains important information such as the code of conduct, and some attendees may only attend the second day.

To use this deck you will need to make a few customizations.

* **Add any sponsor logos** - In the first slide, there is a place to add the logos of sponsors. Add these to the `logos` array in the front matter.
* **Code of conduct** - Update the code of conduct slide to reflect your code of conduct.
* **Logistics** - Update the logistics slide to reflect the relevant logistics, such as the location of toilets and refreshments, fire rules etc.
* **Mentors and speakers** - Update the mentors and speakers slide to reflect the mentors and speakers at the event, updating their picture, name, job details, and social media handle. Although it can be easy to use avatars from social media, try to use images that are recognizable to help the attendees identify the mentors and speakers later.
  This slide is set as a 6 column, 2 row grid. The columns go image, details, image, details, image, details, with 2 rows of mentors and speakers. This gives space for 6 people. If you need to add more, then it is better to add more slides that are duplicates of this layout.
* **Day 1** - Update this to reflect the timing of day 1, and update any networking activities. If you are presenting this on day 2, you can skip this slide.
* **Day 2** - Update this to reflect the timing of day 2, and update any networking activities. Update the sessions to reflect what is being delivered by the speakers. It is worth showing this on day 1, so attendees know what is coming on the second day.
