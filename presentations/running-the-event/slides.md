# What do we mean by 'event in a box'?

<!--

By event in a box - what we mean is the GitHub repo contains everything you need to know to run the event, from slides to instructions, to some video walkthroughs of the sessions.

Pretty much the only thing you need in addition to this repo is a venue, food, wifi and attendees!

-->

<!--

The goal of putting this in a box is to provide everything you need to run this event successfully.

The aim is anyone can use this repo to run a successful event with minimal work.

Demo the repos at this point.

# Overview of the event

## Day 1 - GitHub basics.
<br/>
Attendees start by contributing to their own profile readme.

Then they learn how to contribute in groups to an 'open source project' - CubeFlyer!

<!--

The first day focuses on GitHub basics. Attendees will learn how to:

- Sign up for GitHub
- Create their first profile readme
- Understand repos, branches, commits, pull requests
- Understand forks and git flow, and how to contribute to an open source project
- Deal with simple merge conflicts

Most importantly - they will learn how to collaborate and have fun

-->

---

# Overview of the event

## Day 2 - Open source basics.
<br/>
Day 2 kicks off with talks on open source. Some are provided, some require finding speakers to talk about any topic around open source, such as their open source 'origin story', or tips on finding projects.

Then the attendees continue contributing to Cube Flyer, but learn about the different ways folks can contribute to open source

<!--

The second day focuses on open source basics.

The day starts with talks on open source. One is provided in the bootcamp - a talk on licensing, contributing and CLAs. The other talks give you the opportunity to find local speakers who have fun topics to share - for example their 'open source origin story' to share how they got into open source, or how open source contributed to their career.

If you can't find speakers there are 3 pre-recorded ones linked to in the bootcamp guide.

Then they learn about all the ways to contribute to open source:

- Write code
- DevOps
- Documentation
- Design
- Project management

Most importantly - they will learn how to collaborate and have fun

-->

# Walkthrough of running an event

<!--

The best way to describe the event is to walkthrough the whole thing, from planning to execution

-->

---

# Before the event

To prepare for this event, you will need

- Presenters and mentors
- A venue with Wifi, screens, and a good audio system
- Food and drink if possible
- Ideas/equipment for networking games
- An enforced code of conduct

<!--

As you prepare, you will need a team of presenters and mentors. You need people who are willing to present all the provided sessions, as well as give talks on open source.

This event was designed to be run in person. The reason is the major focus of this event is to teach collaboration. The attendees will be split into teams to work on code together, with one person as a project maintainer. If you do this remotely, there is no guarantee that the team members will complete the tasks, or the maintainer will merge code.

If you want to try to run this remotely, then it is recommended you do it with:

- an audience you know well
- mentors doing the role of maintainers, so enough mentors for small teams no bigger than 5 people
- a good remote presentation and chat tool where folks can easily communicate with each other

If you do run this remotely, then please give feedback on how well it went!

For in-person, the venue needs wifi, and screens to present from that are big enough for all the attendees to see clearly.

This is an all day event over 2 days, so it is important the attendees can eat and drink. If you cannot provide food, then this MUST be communicated to the attendees in advance so they can bring their own.

As part of learning to collaborate, attendees will be in teams. It can be fun to play some networking games, like scavenger hunts to help teams form. You should plan these in advance and ensure you have everything you need available.

You need a code of conduct and people to enforce this.

-->

---

# Before the event

Once you have the pre-requisites:

- Read through the event repo - everything is in the bootcamp guide
- Plan who will be giving the talks so they have time to learn the materials and practice
- Plan who will be mentoring and ensure they work through the materials so they know what to expect
- Share your event
- Get folks to sign up!
- Ask about accessibility accommodations

<!--

Proper planning is important - you should read the bootcamp guid repo thoroughly, and get all mentors and speakers to do the same.

You should also plan not only who is giving each talk, but who is a backup - mentors and speakers may need to drop out at last minute due to illness or other reasons. Once you know who is doing what, they should read the guide and ensure they know how to deliver the sessions and have the relevant knowledge to mentor the attendees.

Then you are ready to publicize the event and get folks to sign up! It's good to have an awareness of how many attendees you are expecting to ensure you have enough mentors/food/drink etc. Expect a large drop off, but that depends on your community - you should know best as to the drop off rate you expect!

When your attendees sign up, you should ask if they need any accommodations and try your best to provide these - for example having clear step-free access for wheelchair users, or lactation/nursing rooms parents.

-->

---

# Before the event

Prepare the presentations

All the presentations are in the bootcamp guide repo, and use Sli.Dev. Sli.Dev allows you to write markdown and have it render as a slide deck.

There are instructions in the guide repo on how to run these. Sli.Dev has both a slide view and a presenter view, and all the slide decks have speaker notes that appear on the presenter view.

- You can either install the required packages, or run the guide repo in a dev container.
- Take some time to familiarize yourself with running and navigating the slides
- Customize each slide deck with your name and picture

<!--

All presentations are provided as slides using Sli.Dev - a tool that turns markdown into slides. Full instructions to run these are provided in the repo, so take some time to get used to presenting using Sli.Dev.

Sli.Dev has both a presentation view and a speaker view - the speaker view has speaker notes, a preview of the next slide etc. Get familiar with how these work so you are not wasting the attendees time trying to get slides running.

If you don't want to install Sli.Dev locally, you can open the repo in VS Code with Docker running, and open the dev container. Check out the VS Code dev containers docs to learn more, but this means you can run without installing anything locally - the dev container is all set up for you.

# Structure of each event day

Each event day is around 4 hours of split over 6 hours:

- 30 minutes for attendees to arrive and get settled (and breakfast if possible)
- 2 hours of sessions
- 1 hour for lunch and networking
- 2 hours of sessions
- Wrap up and time for attendees to chat and leave

<!--

This event is designed around 4 hours of content spread over a day - for example from 9:30 to 3:30.

You need time for attendees to arrive and get settled. If you can offer breakfast during this time then that helps! If not ask attendees to bring their own.

Then it's 2 hours for the morning sessions

1 hour for lunch and a chance for attendees to network/talk through the morning

Back for 2 more hours for the afternoon session

Then wrap up with time for attendees to chat/exchange linkedIn profiles or other contact details.

In the past when this event has been run with sessions ending at 3pm, it's at least 4pm when the organizers had to force the rest of the attendees out of the door!

-->

---

# The event - day 1

Day 1 is broken up into these sections:

- Welcome
- Networking activity/ice breaker
- Get signed up with GitHub
- Connect on GitHub
- Introduction to GitHub
- Lunch break
- Networking activity
- Make your first project contribution
- Make your second project contribution
- Wrap up

<!---

On to the event!

-->

---

# Day 1 - Welcome

This is where you introduce the event:

- Share the code of conduct
- Talk through logistics (such as the location of the toilets, food etc.).
- Introduce the mentor team
- Introduce the schedule for the event
- Encourage folks to network and use the pac man rule!

<!--

Pac man rule - when you form a circle to talk always leave a space - keep the mouth of PacMan open to provide space for someone to join. If they join, expand the circle to reopen PacMans mouth.

-->

---

# Day 1 - Networking activity/ice breaker

Open source is about teams - so this event gives folks a chance to get to know each other and play a game.

For example - have a scavenger hunt to find hidden items.

<!--

These events can be a lot of fun for folks. When this event was first run at the Microsoft Reactor in Redmond, the first networking game was for teams to find the oldest bit of technology - a paper tape with Microsoft basic from 1975. We gave prizes in the form of swag.

Prizes can be nice if you have them - cheap swag such as stickers can be ideal.

Some attendees won't want to take part, and this is fine - don't force anyone. Also be mindful of accessibility issues.

-->

---

# Day 1 - Get signed up with GitHub

This session gets everyone signed up for GitHub, and gets them to install VS Code and GitHub desktop - 2 tools used for this event.

If all your attendees already have GitHub accounts you can skip this section. If any do not, even if it is just one person, work through it to ensure everyone is at the same place.

The presentation for this section has all the instructions, as well as screenshots. It also has an embedded YouTube video, so you will need to be able to play sound from your device.

<!--

If folks are experts and want to use other tools instead of GitHub desktop or VS Code they can, but this bootcamp has no support for that.

If you can't play sound from your device, then skip the video, or use captions.

-->

---

# Day 1 - Connect on GitHub

This activity is to get folks to share their GitHub handles with those attendees around them.

This highlights the social nature of GitHub.

<!--

This should be optional as some folks won't want to connect.

-->

---

# Day 1 - Introduction to GitHub

This session introduces GitHub and gets folks to make their first commit!

Attendees will create a profile repo (one with the same name as their GitHub user name), and create their profile. This covers:

- Creating a repo
- Creating a branch
- Making a commit from inside GitHub
- Raising and merging a PR

<!--

This is the attendees first chance to make a commit!

If attendees already have a profile README, then they can work on a different repo.

-->

---

# Day 1 - Lunch break

🍕 This is an opportunity to take a break, and eat whilst getting to know everyone.

<!--

If you can provide food then great! But please be mindful of dietary requirements and provide ways for folks to eat food they have bought along.

During this time encourage attendees to network. Use mentors and speakers to help start conversations and bring people together. The top feedback we have received on this event in the past is networking is important.

-->

---

# Day 1 - Networking activity

After lunch, give everyone a networking activity to do.

<!--

This keeps the conversations going. THe bootcamp guide repo has some ideas for networking games, but there's lots of choices

Be mindful of attendees who don't want to take part, this MUST be allowed.

# Day 1 - Make your first project contribution

Time to contribute to open source with CubeFlyer!

Divide the attendees into teams, and each team selects a project maintainer.

<!--

Cube flyer is a canned open source project we have provided for attendees to work on.

It is a 'simple' game - use the space bar or mouse button to lift the cube, gravity brings it back down. Try to fit through the gaps and avoid the blocks, floor and ceiling.

To work on this, you need teams. These teams simulate the teams of people working on an open source project - with a maintainer in charge of the project.

Get attendees to form teams and pick a maintainer.

# Cube Flyer

The cube flyer game can be found at **github.com/open-source-bootcamp/CubeFlyer**

<!--

There is a template repo at github.com/open-source-bootcamp/CubeFlyer. This provides a template that maintainers can use to create their own repo.

CubeFlyer is a javascript based game using BabylonJS. You can run it by opening the `index.html` file in the `game` folder in the repo in your browser and it will run out of the box, with no need for a web server.

Mentors should launch the game, and familiarize themselves with the code.

-->


---

# The Cube Flyer repo

This is a template repo.

Each maintainer should use the template to create their own repo.
<br/>
When a new repo is created a few issues are also created.

<!--

The cube flyer repo is a template - this is you can use it to create a new repo that is pre-populated with the cube flyer code.

The maintainers - one per team - should use this template to create a new repo.

Once the repo is created, a github action will create a set of issues - these will be used for the rest of the days session.

This repo has 2 actions - one is run automatically to create the issues for day 1, the other is run manually on day 2. Make sure folks don't run this action early.

Mentors should familiarize themselves with these issues, and get some ideas on how to implement them.

-->

---

# The Cube Flyer repo

Each attendee will fork the maintainers repo and work on adding a new greeting.

Then they will raise a PR and learn about merge conflicts.

Finally the maintainer will close the issue.

<!--

The first task is to add text to the greetings list. Every team member will fork the maintainers repo and add a greeting.

They don't for the template repo - this is important. They MUST fork the maintainers repo.

Once they fork, they add some text to a file to add a new greeting in the game. Instructions are provided in one of the issues that is generated.

As the team starts raising PRs and they get merged, some team members will get merge conflicts. This session then teaches how to resolve them.

It is a good idea to practice resolving merge conflicts if the mentors are new to this.

Once the merge conflicts are resolved, the issue can be closed - this teaches the attendees about closing issues, including tagging PRs in issues.

-->

---

# Day 1 - Make your second project contribution

For the last section of the day, teams will make more contributions to Cube Flyer.

The issues created with the repo list the tasks to work on. Each team is free to work on as many issues as they can in the time remaining.
<br/>
It is up to the team to collaborate on these issues, and get them merged into the maintainers repository.

<!--

The rest of the day is for attendees to look at the remaining issues

-->

---

# Day 1 - Make your second project contribution

<!--

These issues give focused work for the teams to do. As mentors, it is helpful if you have looked at these issues in advance so you can provide some guidance.

Attendees should work on the issues, get PRs raised, and get them merged, before closing the issues.

-->

---

# Day 1 - Wrap up

Wrap up the day with a recap, and thank all the mentors and speakers!

---

# The event - day 2

Day 2 is broken up into these sections:

- Welcome
- Networking activity - Cube Flyer challenge
- Contributing, CLAs, and Licensing
- Talks on something
- Lunch break
- Networking activity
- Team contributions to CubeFlyer
- Wrap up

<!---

On to the event!

-->

---

# Day 2 - Welcome

Similar to day 1 - this is where you introduce the second day of the event:

- Share the code of conduct
- Talk through logistics (such as the location of the toilets, food etc.).
- Introduce the mentor team
- Introduce the schedule for the event
- Encourage folks to network and use the pac man rule!

<!--

Even if you gave these details the day before, it's worth giving them again

-->

---

# Day 2 - Networking activity - Cube Flyer challenge

A fun networking game to play here is a Cube Flyer challenge!

Get each team to find their best player - who can last the longest in the game.

Then have the top player from each team compete with each other!

<!--

This has been one of the most fun activities during these events. Each team puts forward a champion player, and they compete against each other for the title of best cube flyer! Do it based off time of play from starting till they lose.

Try to get the audience involved in cheering all the players and counting down to each game.

-->


---

# Day 2 - Contributing, CLAs, and Licensing

This is a talk on the legal and logistical side of open source

This covers contributing, contributor license agreements, open source licensing and other areas.

<!--

All the content for this talk is provided in the slide deck. Always clarify that this is for information only, and is not legal advice. For that, folks should consult their lawyers...

This sounds like a scary topic, but everyone needs a basic understanding of what it means to sign a CLA, and how to find out what open source can be used, and what restrictions there are.

This can be a dry topic, so if you have a speaker with a fun personality, this can be a good session for them to do.

-->

---

# Day 2 - Talks on something

This is an opportunity to get local speakers to talk about open source topics that are important to them.

For example:

- Have a maintainer to talk about their journey to becoming a maintainer.
- Have someone talk about how open source helped them get a job
- Have a session on becoming a GitHub campus expert or other open source ambassador

<!--

These talks can be the most interesting part of the day for attendees, and also the hardest to organize as you need folks with stories to tell or talks to share.

If you get stuck, the bootcamp guide repo has links to a few pre-recorded sessions.

-->

---

# Day 2 - Lunch break

🍕 This is an opportunity to take a break, and eat whilst getting to know everyone.

<!--

Same as day 1

-->

---

# Day 2 - Networking activity

After lunch, give everyone a networking activity to do.

<!--

Same as day 1

-->

---

# Day 2 - Team contributions to CubeFlyer

This session introduces ways for folks to interact with open source projects

Open source isn't always about code. This session gives attendees an opportunity to contribute in areas such as:

- DevOps
- Documentation
- Project governance
- Cloud deployments

<!--

The aim of this section is to introduce the many ways that folks can contribute.

-->

---

image-width: '800'
---

# Day 2 - Team contributions to CubeFlyer

Create the issues by running an action in the Cube Flyer repo.

<!--

This section has a slide deck that introduces these, and there is an action to create issues for these in the Cube Flyer repo that the maintainer created. The maintainer needs to run this action manually at the start of the session.

The mentors will then need to support the attendees as they look at these issues. It is helpful for mentors to familiarize themselves with these before the event.

-->

---

# Day 2 - Wrap up

Wrap up the event with a recap, and thank all the mentors, speakers and attendees!

As an optional networking activity, you can ask folks to connect with each other on LinkedIn to keep networking after the event.

Now is also a good time to collect feedback. Add anything of note to the discussions in the bootcamp guide repo.

Then rest!

<!--

When you wrap up, it is a good time to ask attendees for their thoughts, maybe through a brief survey. This way you can continually improve the event.

Any general feedback - please report as an issue or a discussion in the bootcamp guide repo.

You should also ask maintainers to keep their repos around for a while so folks can continue to work on issues. ideally encourage attendees to do so to practice async contributions.

-->

# FAQ

## What if an attendee can only attend 1 day?
If they can only attend the first day, this is fine as this teaches the concepts
<br/>
If they can only attend the second day, this is also fine if they are already used to using GitHub and know how to do the tasks from day 1. If they are completely new to GitHub, then they may struggle with the second part of the day.

## I really need to do this remotely
We've never run this remotely, but if you do want to do so:
- Make sure you have reliable maintainers, ideally mentors as maintainers
- Have a good platform to share the talks and chat, such as Discord
- Be aware of when maintainers or team members drop off, and be ready to connect folks to new teams

---

# FAQ

## Do I need a code of conduct
Yes. Attendees need to feel safe and supported, and a part of this is ensuring everyone behaves, and anyone who doesn't is removed from the event.

## I need a venue
Ask around your school - there may be rooms you can use.
Also talk to local tech companies, they may also be happy to sponsor an event, and even provide food!

---

# FAQ

## Some attendees don't want to take part in networking activities
This is fine, never force people to do things they don't want to do

## Something is missing from the guide...
If you find something missing from the guide, raise an issue, or even better a PR!

---

# FAQ

## How much does it cost to use this event in a box?
Nothing - this is free and open source. Do what you want with it!

## Can I charge for my event
Ideally not as this limits who can attend. You could always ask for donations to cover venue costs and food.

---

# Good luck

Good luck with your event!

<!--

Good luck with the event! Ask questions here or in the repo.
